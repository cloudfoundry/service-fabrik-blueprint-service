# Blueprint-Service

## Overview

This service is a sample to demonstrate how services are integrated into the [Service-Fabrik-Broker](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/service-fabrik-broker).

As part of the decoupling process in which the services get more and more separated from the broker itself, the Blueprint-Service serves as sample for the service teams to answer questions how to integrate a service into the broker.

## Requirements

- You need to have installed [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) as well as [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

```
